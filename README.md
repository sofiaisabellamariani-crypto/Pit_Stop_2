# Digital Analysis of *The Secret Sin of Septimus Brope*

## Project Introduction

This repository contains a digital literary analysis of the short story *The Secret Sin of Septimus Brope* by Saki (Hector Hugh Munro). The project combines traditional close reading with the distant reading conducted using Voyant Tools.

## Text and Source

- **Title:** *The Secret Sin of Septimus Brope*
- **Author:** Saki 
- **Lenguage:** English  
- **Edition used:** Short story as published in *The chronicles of Clovis*, 1912, The Bodley Head, John Lane company.
- **Source:** [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/chroniclesofclov00sakirich/mode/2up?ref=ol$0)

## OCR and Text Cleaning Workflow

The text was obtained through the following process:

1. The scanned PDF of the volume was downloaded from the Internet Archive.
2. The PDF was uploaded in Google Docs, where the built-in OCR function was used to convert the scanned images into a text.
3. The resulting text was manually reviewed and cleaned to remove OCR errors, such as incorrect characters, broken words, duplicated headers, and to remove page numbers.
4. Formatting inconsistencies were corrected, and the text was converted into a plain text (.txt) file.
5. The cleaned text was uploaded to this repository as `text.txt` and used as the basis for both the close reading and the Voyant Tools analysis.

This process allowed us to have a readable and reliable digital version of the story, suitable for textual analysis and text insertion into Voyant Tools.

## Analysis Summmary

### Qualitative Analysis (Close Reading)

The close reading focuses on themes such as hypocrisy, double identity, moral surveillance, and cultural hierarchy. Particular attention is paid to narrative voice, dialogue, and key passages that construct and then dismantle the appearance of moral scandal. The analysis highlights how meaning is produced through social interpretation and misinterpretation rather than through direct action or ethical transgression.

### Quantitative Analysis (Voyant Tools)

The distant reading was conducted using Voyant Tools. Given the brevity of the text, the story was analysed both as a single document and as a corpus. This dual approach made it possible to observe both overall lexical patterns and shifts in word frequency across the progression of the story.

## Findings and Reflections

The qualitative and quantitative analyses support and complement each other. Close reading reveals the satirical structure of the story and the central role of language in generating moral panic. Voyant Tools confirms these insights by showing the prominence of dialogue, the stable presence of key characters, and the shifting emphasis between social authority and narrative revelation.

With this project, we can affirm that digital tools are most effective when used in conjunction with traditional literary interpretation. While distant reading alone cannot capture irony or narrative nuance, it can reveal certain types of structural or lexical patterns that strengthen the close reading observations.
